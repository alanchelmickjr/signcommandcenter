# Simply eBay - System Status & Recent Fixes

**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL  
**Last Updated:** December 18, 2024  
**Phase:** Ready for Real eBay API Integration

## üîß Critical Fixes Completed (December 2024)

### Issue: Claude 3.5 Installation Conflicts
**Problem:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet installed multiple conflicting versions of llama-server, causing libmtmd.dylib errors and system instability.

**Solution Applied:**
- Identified conflict between `/usr/local/bin/llama-server` (broken with library issues) and `/opt/homebrew/bin/llama-server` (working)
- Updated `start.sh` to use correct Homebrew path with library compatibility checks
- Added intelligent process detection and cleanup functions
- Enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities

### Issue: AI Model Configuration
**Problem:** Incorrect model file names and missing projection files.

**Solution Applied:**
- Fixed model names: `SmolVLM-500M-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf` + `mmproj-SmolVLM-500M-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf`
- Corrected repository reference: `ggml-org/SmolVLM-500M-Instruct-GGUF`
- Added mmproj file caching and verification
- Implemented M2 Mac compatibility checks

### Issue: App-AI Server Communication
**Problem:** PWA couldn't connect to AI server due to HTTPS/HTTP protocol mismatch.

**Solution Applied:**
- Changed app baseURL from `https://localhost:8443` to `http://localhost:8080`
- Updated all AI server references in `index.html`
- Verified communication chain: Web (8000) ‚Üí AI (8080) ‚Üí Gun.js (8765)
- Confirmed structured eBay data returns properly

## üõ†Ô∏è Current System Architecture

### Process Management
- **Web Server:** Python HTTPS server on port 8000
- **AI Server:** llama-server (SmolVLM) on port 8080  
- **Gun.js Relay:** P2P database on port 8765
- **Process Cleanup:** Intelligent port detection and cleanup

### File Structure Status
```
start.sh          ‚úÖ Extensively modified with debugging
index.html        ‚úÖ Updated baseURL and AI references  
Gun.js relay      ‚úÖ Working (gun-relay.js)
SSL certificates  ‚úÖ Present (cert.pem, key.pem)
AI models         ‚úÖ Downloaded and cached
manifest.json     ‚úÖ PWA ready
```

### Key File Changes
- **start.sh:** Added debugging notes, fixed llama-server path, enhanced cleanup
- **index.html:** Updated AI server communication endpoints
- **Process flow:** Web ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Gun.js all verified working

## üöÄ Next Phase: Real eBay API Integration

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ AI image processing working
- ‚úÖ Local data storage working  
- ‚úÖ PWA interface operational
- ‚úÖ Price estimation with mock data
- ‚è≥ **Ready for real eBay API credentials**

### Required for Production
1. **eBay API Credentials Configuration**
   - Client ID and Secret from eBay Developer account
   - Sandbox environment testing
   - OAuth token management setup

2. **Real Listing Integration**
   - Connect to live eBay API endpoints
   - Test listing creation workflow
   - Verify pricing accuracy vs mock data

3. **Final Testing**
   - End-to-end workflow validation
   - Mobile device compatibility
   - Performance optimization

## üìã Development Notes

### Debugging Information
All scripts now include comprehensive debugging headers for future sessions. Critical paths and common issues are documented in-line.

### Known Working Commands
```bash
# Start the complete system
./start.sh

# Test AI server directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/completion \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"test","image_data":"base64..."}'

# Check process status
ps aux | grep -E "(llama-server|python|gun-relay)"
```

### Environment Requirements
- macOS with Homebrew
- llama.cpp via Homebrew (not /usr/local/bin/)
- Python 3 with ssl support
- Node.js for Gun.js relay
- Modern web browser for PWA

## üéØ Current Priority
Configure real eBay API credentials and test sandbox listing creation to complete the core functionality pipeline.
