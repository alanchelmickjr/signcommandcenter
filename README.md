# Check if llama.cpp is running
ps aux | grep llama-server
# Restart AI server  
./start.sh
# Verify port 8080 is available
lsof -i :8080
```

**"ASL Server Connection Failed"**
```bash
# Check ASL server status
ps aux | grep asl_server
# Check logs
tail -f asl-server.log
# Restart system
./start.sh
```

**"Camera Access Denied"**
- Enable camera permissions in browser
- Use HTTPS (https://localhost:8443) for camera access
- Check browser developer console for errors

**"SSL Certificate Issues"**
- Accept the self-signed certificate in browser
- Certificates are auto-generated on first run
- Use Chrome/Safari for best SSL support

**"Training Data Not Collecting"**
- Check ASL server logs: `tail -f asl-server.log`
- Verify training directories exist
- Use the Training Data modal to check status
