### Vision Pipeline
```
Camera Feed → SmolVLM → ASL Recognition → Command Mapping → Action Execution
     ↓              ↓            ↓              ↓              ↓
  WebRTC        OpenAI API    Confidence     Switch/Case    Robot/Home
                              Scoring         Commands       APIs
```

### Training Loop
```
ASL Signs → Image Capture → Dataset Logging → SmolVLM Training → Improved Recognition
```

### Integration Points
- **Robot API**: `/robot/command` endpoint for arm control
- **Vapi API**: Voice assistant integration for TTS/STT
- **Smart Home**: MQTT/HTTP endpoints for device control
- **Training Server**: `/ml/log_sign` for dataset collection

## 💡 Demo Script for Judges

1. **Show ASL Recognition**: Sign "Hello" → System responds with speech
2. **Robot Control**: Sign "Robot pick up" → Robot arm activates  
3. **Training Data**: Show real-time data collection for ML improvement
4. **Accessibility**: Demonstrate TTS feedback for hearing users
5. **Smart Home**: Sign "Lights on" → Home automation response

ps aux | grep llama-server
# Restart AI server  
llama-server -hf ggml-org/SmolVLM-500M-Instruct-GGUF
# Verify port 8080 is available
lsof -i :8080
```

**"Camera Access Denied"**
